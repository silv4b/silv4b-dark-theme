# Silv4b's Dark Theme 🌚

[Install ✨](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silv4b.silv4b-dark-theme)

## About

Here is my first VS Code theme, builded by myself. I like dark themes so it's full dark.

A dark blue tone theme, different from the standard black/gray tones we're used to. I took inspiration from the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) and the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) themes.

## To install

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
