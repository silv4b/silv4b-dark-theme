# Silv4b's Dark Theme 🌚

## About
Here is my first VS Code theme, builded by myself. I like dark themes so it's full dark.

I took inspiration from the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) and the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) themes.

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for understanding! 🙏🏽
