## About

Here is my first VS Code theme, builded by myself. I like dark themes so it's full dark.

I took inspiration from the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) and the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) themes.

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for understanding! 🙏🏽

## To install

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
